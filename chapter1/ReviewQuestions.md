# Review Questions 

## R1
In the terminology of CNTDP, there is no semantic difference between a host and an end system, they both refer to termnial nodes in a network.  

Some end systems include: 
- A phone 
- A table 
- A home computer 
- A smart Fridge 
- A sat-navn 
- A Web-server 
- A Mail-server 
- A Game console 

## R2
One possible greeting protocol: 
- Greeting 
- Greeting 
- Pleasantries
- Pleasantries  
- Information 
- Question 
- Reply 
- Farewell 
- Farewell


## R3
Internet protocols is a set of rules that systems follow to transfer data between each other in a network.  
Standards are important because they allow systems in a network to synchronize the transfer of data, avoid wasted i.e. if one system experiences congestion, accurately transfer information across many systems.

- Ethernet - Home/enterprise 
- Wifi - Home/enterprise 
- Coaxial cable (e.g. in broadband) - Home
- DSL (digital subscriber line) - Home 
- 5G (public) - wide area access 

## R5
In Hybrid fiber-coaxial HFC, optical fiber carries signals from an ISP's headend to a fiber node.  
The fiber node converts the signal from an optical signal to an electrical signal which is distributed over coaxial cables that connect the fiber node to end systems (usually homes) that share bandwidth. All downstream packets orignate from a single head and there are therefore no collisions. (p 44-45)

## R6
Access technologies that are considered inexpensive to install, maintain and that do not have to server many users at a time. 

These could include: 
- DSL - possible through already connected phone cables 
- 5G - great range that can serve a good number of users

## R7
DSL is considered faster than dial-up because of DSLs make use of signmal segmentation. DSL uses a splitter and a formatter (DSLAM) to create three different frequency bands to send and recieve data: a high-speeed downstream channel (50kHz-1MHz), a medium speed upstream channel(4kHz-50kHz), and a two-way telephone channel(0-4kHz). Due to the higher frequency bands, DSL can transfer data much faster than a dial-up connection that has to use the slow telephone channel.   


## R8
Some possible physical media that can be used to run an ethernet over
- twisted-pair copper wires 
- coaxial cable 
- fiber optic cables

## R9
{download/upload}
- HFC: {40Mbps/1.2Gbps}, bandwidth is shared 
- DSL: {24-52 Mbps/3.5 Mbps}, bandwidth is not shared 
- FTTH: {Gpbs?}, bandwidth is not shared 

## R10
Different wireless technologies that I often use: 
- Bluetooth - transmits data between systems using radio waves. It has a relatively short range (10m) and permits a limited number of end systems as part of the network at any given time. Mainly used for inter-device communication. Creates its own network rather than relying on a router. Less secure since no password is required. Due to signal strength, more prone to intereference. 
- Wifi - similarly transmits data between systems using radio waves. Has a longer range (50m). Mostly used for smaller network communication. Connects devices via a router. Often requires a password to access. 
\
As a user, I care about the speed at which data is initially sent to my device (total delay) and data transfer speed that I can expect (average throughput), and the range that is required to connect to the network.
